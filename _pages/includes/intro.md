I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Geography, 
The University of Hong Kong. I graduated from Department of Earth System Science, 
Tsinghua University (清华大学地球系统科学系) with a doctoral degree advised by Prof. Zhu Liu (刘竹) and Philippe Ciais (from LSCE), 
and from the School of Geography and Planning, Sun Yat-sen University (中山大学地理科学与规划学院) with a bachelor’s degree. 

I am now working on near-real-time carbon accounting, greenhouse gas budget reconciliation and sustainability data research. 
I have published more than 20 papers at the top international journals <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bzZYiBgAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fzhudeng94%2Fzhudeng94.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.
